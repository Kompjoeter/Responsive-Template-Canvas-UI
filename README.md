# Responsive Template Canvas UI

# Description
A Responsive Template User Interface to be used with the HTML Canvas. The Canvas is made to fill device width/height and the Menu is collapsible. The Input Elements inside the Menu can be customized to fit your preference (Not all HTML Input Elements are pre-styled in the CSS, check the example, or **#Contents** to see which are ready for use.

My purpose for making this project was to make it easier for myself and others to add interactivity through UI to a Canvas program.
